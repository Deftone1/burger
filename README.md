# EAT-DA-BURGER

Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant application that allows users to input the name of a burger of their choice. Once a user has submitted their burger's name, the application will display the user's burger in the waiting area on the left-hand side of the page underneath the header. From there, it will remain in the waiting area until the user clicks the 'devour it!' button, and then it will be transferred to the right-hand column under the 'devoured' section.

One of the main takeaways from the application is the use of backend databases that will update and store the burgers on the page.

This application was the most difficult assignment to put together, and unfortunately I was not able to get it fully functioning.

I was able to successfully collect the user input from the form but couldn't figure out how to display it on the page, along with the devoured burger section. I also was able to successfully pull my data from the created Database in MySql.

I hope to revisit the project at some point once I am more familiar with the topics and make it fully functional.
