# EAT-DA-BURGER

Eat-Da-Burger is a restuarant application that allows users to input the name of a burger of their choice. Once a user has submitted their burger's name, the application will display the user's burger in the waiting area on the left-hand side of the page underneath the header. From there, it will remain in the waiting area until the user clicks the 'devour it!' button, and then it will be transferred to the right-hand column under the 'devoured' section.

One of the main takeaways from the application is the use of backend databases that will update and store the burgers on the page.

This application was very difficult to put together, and was one of the first homework assignments that used the MVC design pattern. Getting used to this initially was very complex and required extensive research.
